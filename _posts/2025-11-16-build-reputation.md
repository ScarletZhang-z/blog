# I'm done hiding—now I'm shining 

You don't need to be 100% ready to shine.

Showing up at 60% is shining in itself.

| Stop shrinking |  | Give yourself permission to shine |
| --- | --- | --- |
| I used to say: |  | The point of "Now I'm shining" isn't "You've gotten stronger"—it's about revealing your original light. |
| Worried about what others think of you. Hesitant to speak up. Worried about not being good enough or professional. Careful in front of people you like, afraid of "not performing well" in front of mentors. |  | Energy. Emotional empathy. Social skills. Warmth. Creativity. Thinking ability. Speed of growth. Motivation. Presence. |

# Reputation
> You can't build a reputation on what you're going to do.


**Reputation = value delivered, not value possible in the future.**



# NETWORKING
> NETWORKING: TRY THIS. HI: Best part of your week. LOW: Most challenging. BUFFALO: Something unexpected about you.


"Maybe I can share my hi, low, and buffalo—we used this in a workshop and I liked it."

"This is something I learned in a workshop—hi is the best part of your week, low is the most challenging, and buffalo is something unexpected."

# The Four Hurdles
> The Four Hurdles: Lack of Confidence. Personality Blaming. Lack of Know-How. **Overwhelm & Inaction—Overwhelmed → Stagnation**
> 


**1 Everyone gets stuck (it's not just your problem)**

So don't beat yourself up over it.

**2 There are only 4 types of reasons for getting stuck**

Every problem you face fits into one of these 4 categories.

**3 Once you know which category you're in → you can find the right solution**

For example:

- Lack of knowledge → learn
- Lack of confidence → take small steps
- Overwhelm → simplify tasks
- Blame yourself → shift to a skill-learning mindset

**4 Recognizing the obstacle is more important than pushing harder**

Because the harder you go in the wrong direction, the more exhausted you become.


# Reputation Now
> Reputation Now:
  1. CHARACTER **Question: What would others say about you when you're not in the room?** 
 2. CAPABILITY **Question: Is there something you're known for delivering better than most?** 
3. COMMUNICATION **Question: If someone were to advocate for you, is it clear what they'd say?**
> 

Your current reputation is a combination of how people see you as a person + your ability + your label.

> Three years from now, when people introduce me, what do I want them to say?
> 

Who you are now → how you want to be seen in the future → the gap in between = what you're going to do next.


# SOAR
> What is SOAR?

SOAR is a storytelling framework that's clearer and better for documenting growth than STAR.

It has four parts:

**S - Situation**

What happened? What's the context?

**O - Obstacle**

What's the problem? What's the difficulty?

⭐ This is the key to SOAR because "Obstacle = where your value appears."

**A - Action**

What did you do? What specific behaviors did you take? (Focus on "I," not the team.)

**R - Result**

What are the results? Numbers, impact, growth—what do people say about you?

# the Three Principles of Marketing

> Put the Three Principles of Marketing in your Elevator Pitch so people remember you, understand you, and want to help you faster.
> 

**AWARENESS - What do you want people to know about you? (Building impressions)**

**VALUE PROPOSITION - Why you? (Your value, your highlights)**

**CALL TO ACTION - What do you want them to do next? (Tell them "what's next")**

**Why do this?**

Because in networking, workplace, or mentor events:

- If you don't give people a label, they won't remember you.
- If you don't talk about your value, they don't know why they should care about you.
- If you don't give next steps, they don't know how to help you.

That's why many people don't make a connection after they introduce themselves.

They're sharing "facts," not "brand."

# V - Visual. A - Auditory. K - Kinesthetic.
> 

You need to communicate in a way that reaches all three types of people: Visual, Auditory, and Kinesthetic.

> **Reputation Reboot (Bingo!)**
> 

| **Reconnect with your WINS** | **Ask for a BOOST** | **Try a Tiny RISK** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Share a success story with a friend/colleague | Ask someone "Tell me something I do well?" | Say YES to ONE new thing today |
| Write down 2 things you learned from your latest setback | Message someone you admire and ask for a chat | Do one thing you've been avoiding |
| Reflect on a compliment you received—Why did it matter? | Send a Thank You to someone who helped you | Create a bold LinkedIn post |

Reconnect with your confidence and remember your value.

Rebuild positive perceptions and learn more about yourself.

Change your behavior and build a new professional image.

It's a "Small Habits → Big Impact" system.

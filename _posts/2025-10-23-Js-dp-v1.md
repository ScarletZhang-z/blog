# From Zoo to Factory ü¶Å

*‚Äî For Front-End Developers in 2025*

> Don‚Äôt rush. The world will wait for you to grow.

## 1. Why Should Front-End Developers Learn Design Patterns?

Design patterns were born from object-oriented software engineering, crafted to solve recurring problems in object creation and composition.

As front-end development evolved from ‚Äúbuilding static pages‚Äù to ‚Äúmanaging state and complex business logic,‚Äù we began facing the same architectural challenges: countless components, tangled dependencies, and tight coupling between client and server.

Now, with AI-assisted code generation and automated build tools, our code changes faster than ever ‚Äî making it harder to maintain clarity and structure amid constant change.

That‚Äôs exactly where design patterns help. **They keep what changes flexible, and what doesn‚Äôt change stable.**

Of course, not every pattern fits front-end development. Take the five SOLID principles ‚Äî the ones that truly resonate with front-end engineers are **Single Responsibility** and **Open‚ÄìClosed**.

In this series, I‚Äôll break down design patterns using simple, vivid examples. My hope is that in this noisy, fast-moving industry, we can slow down, learn with intention, and grow together as more thoughtful developers.



## 2. Constructor Pattern: Building a Zoo üêí

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre building a zoo management system. You start by recording animals like this:

```js
const monkey = {
  name: 'King Kong',
  age: 1
}

const tiger = {
  name: 'Tiger',
  age: 3
}
```

It works ‚Äî until your zoo gets crowded and you‚Äôre trapped in **copy-paste hell**.
To avoid this, you can use a **constructor** to encapsulate the object creation logic:

```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name
    this.age = age
  }
}

const monkey = new Animal('King Kong', 1)
const tiger = new Animal('Tiger', 3)
```

In JavaScript, a **constructor** is a special function used to create and initialize objects.
We invoke it with the `new` keyword.

The **constructor pattern** simply means wrapping the initialization logic inside a function or class so that object creation becomes standardized and consistent.

Each instance of `Animal` has the same structure (`name`, `age`), but different values.
This pattern separates what‚Äôs *stable* (the structure) from what‚Äôs *variable* (the data).

> **The constructor pattern abstracts the ‚Äúchange within a single object.‚Äù
> The factory pattern abstracts the ‚Äúchange between different constructors.‚Äù**

In other words:

* The constructor helps you **build one animal**.
* The factory helps you **decide which kind of animal to build**.

When your system has multiple object types with complex creation logic, constructors alone are not enough ‚Äî you‚Äôll need a factory to manage the creation process.

## 3. Simple Factory Pattern üè≠

Now the zoo has a new requirement:

> Each animal should be assigned different food based on its diet.

That means our `Animal` class isn‚Äôt flexible enough ‚Äî we need specialized types:

```js
class Vegetarian {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name
    this.age = age
    this.favorite = 'fruit'
    this.food = ['apple', 'banana']
  }
}

class Carnivore {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name
    this.age = age
    this.favorite = 'meat'
    this.food = ['beef', 'pork']
  }
}
```

But as you add more animals, you‚Äôll end up with **a jungle of classes** ‚Äî
and they all share similar properties (`name`, `age`).

So let‚Äôs extract the common parts and let a **factory function** handle the differences:

```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name, age, favorite, food) {
    Object.assign(this, { name, age, favorite, food })
  }
}

// Simple factory: create animals by diet type
const createAnimal = (type, name, age) => {
  const animalConfig = {
    fruit: { favorite: 'fruit', food: ['apple', 'banana'] },
    meat: { favorite: 'meat', food: ['beef', 'pork'] },
    vegetable: { favorite: 'vegetable', food: ['cabbage'] }
  }

  const config = animalConfig[type] || { favorite: 'unknown', food: [] }
  const { favorite, food } = config

  return new Animal(name, age, favorite, food)
}

// Simple and elegant!
const monkey = createAnimal('fruit', 'King Kong', 1)
const tiger = createAnimal('meat', 'Tiger', 3)
```

Now, no matter how many animal types we add,
we only need to extend the factory ‚Äî not rewrite every class.

That‚Äôs the **core idea of the Simple Factory Pattern**:

> *Let one function encapsulate the creation logic.*
> The caller just needs to say **what** they want,
> without worrying about **how** it‚Äôs created.

## 4. Factory Pattern in Modern Frameworks

The factory pattern is everywhere ‚Äî you just might not notice it.

### React Example

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Button, Card } from './components'

const createComponent = (type, props) => {
  const components = {
    button: Button,
    card: Card
  }

  const Component = components[type] || 'div'
  return <Component {...props} />
}

const App = () => (
  <div>
    {createComponent('button', { label: 'Click me!' })}
    {createComponent('card', { title: 'Hello React' })}
  </div>
)

export default App
```

This is essentially a **component factory** ‚Äî a function that centralizes how components are created and rendered, making the code more flexible and dynamic.

### Vue Example

```js
import { h } from 'vue'
import AlertDialog from './AlertDialog.vue'
import ConfirmDialog from './ConfirmDialog.vue'

const createDialog = (type) => {
  const components = {
    alert: AlertDialog,
    confirm: ConfirmDialog
  }
  return h(components[type] || 'div')
}
```

Vue‚Äôs `h()` (short for *hyperscript*) function is literally a **virtual node factory** ‚Äî
and your `createDialog()` builds on top of it as a **business-level component factory**.

## Next Up üåø

In the next chapter, we‚Äôll talk about the **Abstract Factory Pattern** ‚Äî

When your zoo expands across **continents** (Asian Zoo, African Zoo, etc.),
and each has its own ecosystem and food chain,
the simple factory won‚Äôt be enough.

The abstract factory will show us how to manage a **‚Äúfactory of factories‚Äù**,
making even the creation logic itself modular and scalable.
